        <p>This is what content looks like</p>
        <p>This is my <em>favorite</em> recipe because it was one that I learned from my mom and reminds me of home. I especially

  <p>Collard greens (collards) describes certain loose-leafed cultivars of Brassica oleracea, the same species as many common vegetables, including cabbage (Capitata Group) and broccoli (Botrytis Group). Collard greens are part of the Acephala Group of the species, which includes kale and spring greens. They are in the same cultivar group owing to their genetic similarity. The name "collard" comes from the word "colewort" (the wild cabbage plant)</p>
